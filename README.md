# JavaScript-Code-Quiz

## Description

The project is a quiz about JavaScript fundamentals.
When start button is hit, the timer and question appears.
The user will be prompt with a question and options and has 75 seconds to complete.
If user selects correct answer, the correct answer will highlight green.
If user selects wrong answer, the correct answer will hightlight green, wrong answer will highlight red, and timer will be reduced by 10seconds.
If user runs out of time, the quiz ends.

When quiz is over, the user can either add their initials to be saved or restart the quiz.
Once saved, the leaderboard will display.
The user may decide to clear the scores or go back home.

I learned how to create eventlisteners, use local storage, and web APIs to create this project.
